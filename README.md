# third-world-zombies
A weekend without internet and nothing else to do, so I made this pseudo-game playable in prompts. Didn't used git, so no commits, sorry.

By the way, this thing is in spanish. Didn't planned to share but I want to have it here so I can see how much I have progressed in the future.

The so called "game" is simple: you will fight a random zombie (there's 6 of them, with different HP and power). Choose between (A)ttack or (I)tem ((D)efense does nothing, forgot to add an action, heh). You can heal yourself with bandages or first aid kits. Once you beat a zombie, there's a chance to refill your inventory, and a little chance to find a shotgun. That's it, just some practice from somebody learning Javascript that was really bored.
